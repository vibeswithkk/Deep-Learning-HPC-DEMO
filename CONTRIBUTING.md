- [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting with complexity limits and security rules
- [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for static type checking with strict mode and comprehensive coverage
- [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) for static security analysis with enterprise rule sets
- Comprehensive docstrings for all public APIs using Google style with security considerations
- Type hints for all function signatures and variable declarations with strict enforcement
- Descriptive variable and function names following PEP 8 conventions with business context
- Security validation for input handling, authentication, and data protection with OWASP guidelines

### Enterprise Documentation Standards

All contributions must include appropriate documentation with security and compliance considerations:

- Module-level docstrings with purpose, usage examples, and security implications
- Class docstrings with parameters, attributes, methods, and threat modeling
- Function docstrings with parameters, return values, exceptions, and security validation
- Inline comments for complex logic and algorithmic decisions with optimization rationale
- README updates for new features or significant changes with enterprise deployment guides
