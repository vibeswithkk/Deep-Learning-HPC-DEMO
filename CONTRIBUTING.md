## Development Setup

### Environment Configuration

1. Fork and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-learning-hpc-demo.git
   cd deep-learning-hpc-demo
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv hpc_demo_dev
   source hpc_demo_dev/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   # OR
   hpc_demo_dev\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

### Development Tools Configuration

Configure your development environment with the following tools:

- **IDE**: PyCharm, VS Code, or similar with Python support
- **Formatter**: Black for automatic code formatting
- **Linter**: Flake8 for code style checking
- **Type Checker**: MyPy for static type analysis
- **Debugger**: pdb or IDE-integrated debugger
- **Profiler**: cProfile for performance analysis

## Code Style and Standards

### Python Coding Standards

We follow these coding standards to maintain consistency and quality:

- [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) for Python code style with 88-character line limits
- [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for automatic code formatting with default settings
- [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting with complexity limits
- [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for static type checking with strict mode
- Comprehensive docstrings for all public APIs using Google style
- Type hints for all function signatures and variable declarations
- Descriptive variable and function names following PEP 8 conventions

### Documentation Standards

All contributions must include appropriate documentation:

- Module-level docstrings with purpose and usage examples
- Class docstrings with parameters, attributes, and methods
- Function docstrings with parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Inline comments for complex logic and algorithmic decisions
- README updates for new features or significant changes
- Configuration file documentation with parameter descriptions

### Testing Requirements

All contributions must include comprehensive tests:

- Unit tests for new functionality with 95%+ coverage targets
- Integration tests for major features with end-to-end validation
- Performance tests for computationally intensive operations
- Edge case testing for error conditions and boundary values
- Cross-platform compatibility testing where applicable
- Regression tests for bug fixes to prevent reoccurrence

Run tests with:
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_module.py

# Run tests with performance profiling
pytest --profile tests/
```

## Documentation Updates

### Documentation Structure

The documentation follows a hierarchical structure:

1. **README.md**: Project overview and quick start guide
2. **docs/index.md**: Comprehensive technical documentation
3. **Module docstrings**: API reference and usage examples
4. **Configuration files**: Parameter descriptions and examples
5. **Example scripts**: Practical implementation demonstrations

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language with technical accuracy
- Include practical examples and code snippets
- Provide cross-references to related components
- Maintain consistent formatting and structure
- Update version-specific information
- Include performance considerations and limitations

## Pull Request Process

### Submission Requirements
